# hello-world
First github experience
I am slowly re-learning the basics of coding while working on becoming a registered dietitian. While the two paths may seem completely different, learning to code will allow me to have my own website to spread my knowledge of nutrition and build my own business. I will also be able to use my experience as a developer to maintain a decent paying job while in training.
